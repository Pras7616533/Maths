# Maths

This repository contains various Python scripts for solving mathematical problems and algorithms. It includes the following files:

- **bi.py**: Contains functions inspired by BÃ©zout's identity, which is useful for solving linear Diophantine equations and understanding integer combinations.
- **gcd.py**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
- **bisectionedit.py**: Uses the bisection method to find roots of continuous functions by repeatedly halving an interval and selecting the subinterval in which the root exists.
- **false_method.py**: Implements the false position (or regula falsi) method for root-finding, which is an improvement over the bisection method by using a secant line.
- **jc2007.py**: A custom script that might relate to numerical methods or specific problem-solving techniques (further details would be needed for precise description).
- **poisson.py**: Calculates Poisson distribution probabilities, useful in scenarios where events occur independently and at a constant average rate.
- **probability.py**: Contains functions related to various probability calculations, possibly including combinatorial probabilities, distributions, and statistical measures.
